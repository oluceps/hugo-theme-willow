**Oedipus**

Child of a blind old man, Antigone, to what region have we come, or to what polis of men? Who will entertain the wandering Oedipus today with scanty gifts? 5 Little do I crave, and obtain still less than that little, and with that I am content. For patience is the lesson of suffering [pathos], and of the long years upon me, and lastly of a noble mind. My child, if you see any resting-place, 10 either on profane ground or by groves of the gods, stop me and set me down, so that we may inquire where we are. We have come to learn as strangers [xenoi] from the townsmen, and to bring to fulfillment [telos] whatever we hear.

**Antigone**

Father, toil-worn Oedipus, the towers that 15 ring the polis, to judge by sight, are far off; and this place is sacred [hieros], to judge from its appearance: laurel, olive, and vine grow thick-set; and a feathered crowd of nightingales makes music within. So sit here on this unshaped stone; 20 you have traveled a long way for an old man.

**Oedipus**

Seat me, then, and watch over the blind.

**Antigone**

If time can teach, I need not learn that.

**Oedipus**

Can you tell me, now, where we have arrived?

**Antigone**

Athens I know, but not this place.

**Oedipus**

25 Yes, so much every traveler told us.

**Antigone**

Well, shall I go and learn what the spot is called?

**Oedipus**

Yes, child, if indeed it is inhabited [oikeîn].

**Antigone**

It surely is inhabited [oikeîn]. But I think there is no need—I see a man nearby.

**Oedipus**

30 Setting off and coming toward us?

**Antigone**

He is at our side already. Speak whatever seems timely to you, for the man is here.

**A Xenos enters, a man of Colonus.**

**Oedipus**

Xenos, hearing from this maiden, who has sight both for herself and for me, 35 that you have arrived as a scout of good fortune for the solving of our doubts…

**Xenos**

Now, before you inquire [historeîn] of me at length, leave this seat. You occupy ground which it is unholy to tread upon.

**Oedipus**

And what is this ground? To which of the gods is it sacred?

**Xenos**

Ground inviolable, on which no one may dwell [oikeîn]. The dread 40 goddesses hold it, the daughters of Earth and Darkness.

**Oedipus**

Who are they? Whose awe-inspiring name might I hear and invoke in prayer?

**Xenos**

The all-seeing Eumenides the people here would call them: but other names please elsewhere.

**Oedipus**

Then graciously may they receive their suppliant! 45 Never again will I depart from my seat in this land.

**Xenos**

What does this mean?

**Oedipus**

The watchword of my fate.

**Xenos**

I dare not remove you without warrant from the polis, until I report what I am doing.

**Oedipus**

49 I implore you by the gods, stranger [xenos], do not deprive me of honor [a-tīmân], 50 wanderer that I am, and do point out to me the things I ask you to tell me.

**Xenos**

51Indicate [sēmainein] to me, and it will be clear that you will not be without honor [a-tīmos] from me.

**Oedipus**

52 What, then, is the place [khōros] that I [we] have entered?

**Xenos**

53 All that I myself know, you will hear and learn. 54 This whole place [khōros] is sacred [hieros]; it is possessed 55 by the revered [semnos] Poseidon, and inside it is the fire-bringing god, 56 the Titan Prometheus. Αs for the place [topos] where you have set foot, 57 it is called the Bronze-Step Threshold of this land here. 58 It is the Protection of Athens. And the neighboring fields 59 claim as their own this person here, Colonus [Kolōnos],1 who is the rider of chariots [hippotēs], 60 as their ancient ruler; and all the population bear the name of 61 this person here [= Colonus] as their shared [koinon] possession. 62 Such, you see, stranger [xenos], are these things, which are what they are not because what we say 63 gives them honor [tīmân], but rather because we live in communion [sun-ousiā] with them.

**Oedipus**

64 Are there indeed dwellers in this region?

**Xenos**

65 Yes indeed, the namesakes of this god here [Colonus].2

**Oedipus**

Have they a king? Or does speaking [in assembly] rest with the masses?

**Xenos**

These parts are ruled by the king in the city.

**Oedipus**

And who is he that is sovereign in counsel and in might?

**Xenos**

Theseus he is called, son of Aegeus who was before him.

**Oedipus**

70 Could a messenger go to him from among you?

**Xenos**

With what aim? To speak, or to prepare his coming?

**Oedipus**

So that by a small service he [Theseus] may find a great gain.

**Xenos**

And what help can come from one who cannot see?

**Oedipus**

In all that I speak there will be vision.

**Xenos**

75 Take care now, xenos, that you come to no harm; for you are noble, if I may judge by your looks, leaving your fortune [daimōn] aside. Stay here, where I found you, until I go and tell these things to the people of this district [dēmos]—not in the city. 80 They will decide for you whether you should stay or go back.

**The Xenos exits.**

**Oedipus**

My child, has the xenos left us?

**Antigone**

He is gone, and so you can speak what you wish, father, fully serene [hēsukhos], knowing that I alone am near.

**Oedipus**

Ladies of dread aspect, since your seat is 85 the first in this land at which I have bent my knee, show yourselves not ungracious to Phoebus or to myself; who, when he proclaimed that doom of many woes, spoke to me of this rest after long years: on reaching my goal in a land where I should find a seat of the awe-inspiring Goddesses 90 and a shelter for xenoi, there I should profitably close my weary life, through my having fixed my abode [oikos] there, for those who received me, but ruin [atē] for those who sent me forth, who drove me away. And he went on to warn me that signs [sēmeia] of these things would come, 95 in earthquake, or in thunder, or in the lightning of Zeus. Now I perceive that in this journey some trusty omen from you has surely led me to this grove; never otherwise could I have met with you, first of all, in my wanderings—I, in my sobriety, with you who touch no wine, 100 —or taken this august [semnon] seat not shaped by men. Then, goddesses, according to the word of Apollo, give me at last some way to accomplish and close my course—unless, perhaps, I seem too lowly, 105 enslaved as I am evermore to woes the sorest on the earth. Hear, sweet daughters of primeval Darkness! Hear, you that are called the city of great Athena, Athens, given most tīmē of all cities! Pity this poor phantom of the man Oedipus! 110 For in truth it is the former living body no more.

**Antigone**

Hush! Here come some aged men to spy out your resting-place.

**Oedipus**

I will be mute. But hide me in the grove, apart from the road, till I learn 115 how these men will speak. For in learning is the safeguard of our course.

**They exit. The Chorus of elders of Colonus enters.**
